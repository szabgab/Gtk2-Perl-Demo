enum GtkStateType

typedef enum
{
  GTK_STATE_NORMAL,
  GTK_STATE_ACTIVE,
  GTK_STATE_PRELIGHT,
  GTK_STATE_SELECTED,
  GTK_STATE_INSENSITIVE
  } GtkStateType;

This type indicates the current state of a widget; the state determines how the widget is drawn. The GtkStateType enumeration is also used to identify different colors in a GtkStyle for drawing, so states can be used for subparts of a widget as well as entire widgets.
 GTK_STATE_NORMAL	State during normal operation.
  GTK_STATE_ACTIVE	State of a currently active widget, such as a depressed button.
  GTK_STATE_PRELIGHT	State indicating that the mouse pointer is over the widget and the widget will respond to mouse clicks.
  GTK_STATE_SELECTED	State of a selected item, such the selected row in a list.
  GTK_STATE_INSENSITIVE	State indicating that the widget is unresponsive to user actions.
