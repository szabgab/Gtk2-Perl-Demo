+ =head1 NAME
+
+ Gtk2::Window - Widget for a Window.
+
+ =head1 SYNOPSIS
+
+ # Load and Initialise Gtk2.
+     use Gtk2;
+     Gtk2-&gt;init;
+
+ # Create our Gtk2::Window
+     my $window = Gtk2::Window-&gt;new('toplevel');
+
+ # Show our window to the world.
+     $window-&gt;show;
+
+ # Pass control to the Gtk2 mainloop.
+     Gtk2-&gt;main;
+
+ =head1 DESCRIPTION
+
+ Gtk2::Window is the object which represents a Window.
+
+ =head1 METHODS
+
+ The following methods are available for this object.  This list is not
+ exhaustive.
+
+ =over
+
+ =item B&lt;new($type)&gt;
+
+ This is the constructor method for this widget.  The first and only
+ argument is the &quot;type&quot; of window.  In Gtk2 there are only two types;
+
+     toplevel - Almost all of your windows will be of this type.
+         This is a standard window type.  The window manager has
+ 	full control of it and is able to decorate it (provide
+ 	bars, minimise/iconify/destroy buttons).
+
+     popup    - This window type denies the window manager any
+         control over its positioning, sizing, iconifing or
+         decoration.  This window type is typically used for
+         things like pop-up menus.  Use of this type is rare.
+
+         If you need a window with no decoration, you should still
+         use type &quot;toplevel&quot; but make a call to the set_decorated
+         method below.
+
+ The object or its contents is not rendered until you call the show() or
+ show_all() methods.
+
+ The old behaviour catagorised by the type &quot;dialog&quot; is now achieved using
+ calls which are described in the set_transient_for() and set_position()
+ section.
+
+ =item B&lt;set_title($text)&gt;
+
+ This method allows you to set, or change the text which is displayed as
+ the title of your window as rendered by your window manager.  This
+ defaults to the name of your application.
+
+     $window-&gt;set_title(&quot;MyNewsClient: (Browsing: comp.lang.perl)&quot;);
+
+ =item B&lt;get_title()&gt;
+
+ This method allows you to get the title from your window.  It returns
+ a scalar which contains this text.
+
+     my $text = $window-&gt;get_title();
+
+ =item B&lt;set_resizable($bool)&gt;
+
+ This method allows you to instruct the window manager whether or not the
+ user is allowed to resize the window.  Its single argument is a boolean
+ true or false, or a 1 or 0.
+
+     # Allow resizable
+     $window-&gt;set_resizeable(1);
+
+     # Disallow resizable
+     $window-&gt;set_resizeable(0);
+
+ =item B&lt;get_resizable()&gt;
+
+ This method queries your window object to discover if the Window is
+ resizable.  It returns 1 for true (can be resized) or 0 for false
+ (cannot be resized).
+
+     if ($window-&gt;get_resizable()) {
+         print(&quot;Window is resizable\n&quot;);
+     }
+
+ =item B&lt;set_default_size($width, $height)&gt;
+
+ This method allows you set the B&lt;initial&gt; minimum size of your window.
+ If your widgets within your Window request a larger sized window than
+ you specify here this request will be ignored.
+
+     # Set the initial size of the window to 100x200 pixels.
+     $window-&gt;set_default_size(100,200);
+
+ To change the size of an already rendered window see resize().
+
+ To set size of the Window regardless of the consequences, see
+ set_size_request() in Gtk2::Widget.
+
+ =item B&lt;set_transient_for($main_window)&gt;
+
+ This method allows you to &quot;bind&quot; windows behaviour to another by
+ informing it that the window that you call this method on is
+ &quot;subservient&quot; to $main_window; the first argument you pass.
+
+ This may also affect the initial positioning of the window by the
+ window manager a common positioning policy is to place subservient
+ windows on the top of their parents.  You can request a change
+ in this policy using the set_position() method although, again,
+ the window manager does not have to honour this.
+
+ =item B&lt;get_transient_for()&gt;
+
+ This method allows you to identify the parent window of your
+ window.  It takes no arguments but returns the reference
+ to the parent window.
+
+ =item B&lt;set_position($type)&gt;
+
+ This method allows you to pass hints to the window manager as to where
+ you want your window to appear.  This is only a request, your window
+ manager does not have to honour it.
+
+ Options are:
+
+     none     - This instructs the window manager to use its own
+         policy.
+
+     center   - This instructs the window manager that you wish
+         the window to appear in the center of the screen.
+
+     mouse    - This instructs the window manager that you wish
+         the window to appear at the position that the mouse is.
+
+     center_always - This instructs the window manager that you
+         always want the window to appear in the center, even
+         after resize.
+
+     center_on_parent - This instructs the window manager to
+         position this window in the center on its parent window.
+ 	See set_transient_for().
+
+ Example:
+
+     # Create two windows.
+     my $main_window = Gtk2::Window-&gt;new(-toplevel);
+     my $child_window = Gtk2::Window-&gt;new(-toplevel);
+
+     # Make $child_window subservient to $main_window
+     $child_window-&gt;set_transient_for($main_window);
+
+     # Make $child_window initial placement in the center of
+     # $main_window
+     $child_window-&gt;set_position(-center_on_parent);
+
+     # Render $main_window first else $child_window won't be able to
+     # appear in the center on top of it.
+     $main_window-&gt;show;
+     $child_window-&gt;show;
+
+ =item B&lt;set_destroy_with_parent($bool)&gt;
+
+ This method allows you to set or unset the behaviour whereby the
+ window will destroy itself if its parent window is destroyed (see
+ set_transient_for()).
+
+ The first and only argument is boolean, 0 for false and 1 for true.
+
+     # Suicidal window on death of parent.
+     $window-&gt;set_destroy_with_parent(1);
+
+     # Not suicidal on death of parent.
+     $window-&gt;set_destroy_with_parent(0);
+
+ =item B&lt;present()&gt;
+
+ This method causes the window to appear in front of the user.
+
+ The window may be moved from a different screen, de-iconified, rendered,
+ raised to the top.  It may also give the window focus and move the
+ mouse depending on the configuration of the window manager.
+
+     $window-&gt;present();
+
+ =item B&lt;iconify()&gt;
+
+ This method requests to the window manager than the window be minimised.
+
+     $window-&gt;iconify();
+
+ =item B&lt;deiconify()&gt;
+
+ This method requests to the window manager that the window by de-iconified.
+ You may wish to read the documentation above for present() as this is
+ more likely to be the effect you are looking for in an application
+ design as a window may be de-iconified onto a different screen or under
+ other windows.
+
+     $window-&gt;deiconify();
+
+ =item B&lt;stick()&gt;
+
+ This method causes your window to become sticky.  Sticky windows are
+ windows that stay on the screen even when you change virtual screens.
+
+ Support for this request is variable across window managers.
+
+ =item B&lt;unstick()&gt;
+
+ This method causes your window to cease being sticky.
+
+ Support for this request is variable across window managers.
+
+ =item B&lt;maximize()&gt;
+
+ This method causes your window to maximise the same way as if you had
+ pressed that icon in your window managers decoration.
+
+ =item B&lt;unmaximize()&gt;
+
+ This method causes your window to un-maximise the same way as if you
+ had pressed that icon in your window managers decoration.  The window
+ is restored to its pre-maximised size.
+
+ =item B&lt;fullscreen()&gt; and B&lt;unfullscreen()&gt;
+
+ These methods allow you to fullscreen and unfullscreen your window.
+ This is done by changing the resolution of your X server, placing your
+ window in the middle and blacking out the rest of the screen.
+
+ Although we allow you to pass the request to the window manager
+ its support is very poor.  Expect bad things to happen if you use
+ this.
+
+ =item B&lt;set_decorated($bool)&gt;
+
+ This method allows you to instruct the window manager to apply or
+ not apply decorations to your window.  The default is to allow
+ decorations.  Decorations consist of the borders, title and
+ window manager icons surrounding your window.
+
+     # Make window un-decorated (borderless)
+     $window-&gt;set_decorated(0);
+
+ =item B&lt;get_decorated()&gt;
+
+ This method returns whether the window is decorated or not.  The value
+ returned is 0 for undecorated, or 1 for decorated.
+
+ =item B&lt;get_size()&gt;
+
+ This method allows you to acquire the dimensions of your window.
+ The method returns a list in the for (width, height).
+
+     my ($width, $height) = $window-&gt;get_size();
+
+ Note, these dimensions do not include any window manager decorations.
+
+ =item B&lt;resize($width, $height)&gt;
+
+ This method allows you to resize your window object.  This method is
+ typically called after the window has been displayed.  If you call this
+ method before rendering, then its setting overrides that set
+ by set_default_size().
+
+ If the widgets in the window request more space than you specify in
+ resize(), then this method is silently ignored.

+
+ =head1 SYNOPSIS
+
+ # Load and Initialise Gtk2.
+     use Gtk2;
+     Gtk2-&gt;init;
+
+ # Create a window within which we can display our Gtk2::Label.
+     my $window = Gtk2::Window-&gt;new('toplevel');

+
+ # Or read back the text that is contained within the Gtk2::Label.
+     my $text = $label-&gt;get_text;

+
+ =head1 DESCRIPTION
+
+ Gtk2::Label is a widget which allows you to display a small to medium amount of text.
+ It is different from its Gtk.pm breathern with the addition of some rather useful
+ formatting methods.
+
+ =head1 METHODS
+
+ The following methods are available for this object.  This list is not exhaustive.
+
+ =over
+
+ =item B&lt;new($text)&gt;
+
+ This is the constructor method for this widget.  The single option is a scalar which
+ contains the text you with to display in the widget.  If you specify a carriage return
+ within your text (eg, \n) Gtk2::Label will start a new line at this point.
+
+ The argument is optional as it defaults to an empty string.  This is sometimes useful
+ in occasions when you wish to set the contents of the Gtk2::Label after the widget
+ has been rendered.  See B&lt;set_text&gt; method below.
+
+ my $label = Gtk2::Label-&gt;new(&quot;This is my text\nwhich is on\nthree lines.&quot;);
+
+ =item B&lt;set_text($text)&gt;
+
+ This method allows you to set, or change the text which is displayed within your Label.
+ The only argument is a scalar which contains the text to be set.
+
+  $label-&gt;set_text(&quot;This is the text\nwhich we set after creation&quot;);
+
+ =item B&lt;get_text()&gt;
+
+ This method allows you to get the text which is displayed by your Label.  This method
+ takes no arguments but returns the displayed text.
+
+  my $text = $label-&gt;get_text();
+
+ =item B&lt;set_pattern($pattern)&gt;
+
+ This method allows you to specify characters in your Label to be underlined.  A &quot;pattern&quot;
+ consists of a string which contains either a space (' ') or an underscore ('_').  The
+ position where a space is is rendered as a normal character whereas a position with an
+ underscore is rendered as underlined.
+
+ The following code produces a Label with the word &quot;Underlined&quot; underlined.
+
+ my $label = new Gtk2::Label(&quot;Test Underlined&quot;);
+ $label-&gt;set_pattern(&quot;     __________&quot;);
+
+ =item B&lt;set_justify($GtkJustification)&gt;
+
+ This is a new method which was not available to the Gtk::Label object.  Its single
+ argument is the string 'left', 'right', 'center' or 'fill' to set the text
+ within that widget to that justification style.
