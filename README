No need to install the application. Just unzip it and run gtk-perl-demo.pl


prerequisites:
Glib
Gtk2



for ViewSource to work:
Gnome2  which is currently NOT available on MS Windows.
to install Gnome run

need libgnomeprintui-devel

cpan install Bundle::Gnome2


TODO
============

- Search results should also show the title of the file

- How can I catch the ESC key pressed ?
- How can I display simple HTML files or pod ?
  Gtk2::PodViewer
  Gtk2::Html2, Gtk2::MozEmbed
- How could we include the both the documentation and the Tutorial in the Demo tool?
- How to add an icoon for the Alt-TAB thingy and the image when minimized ?
  Gtk2::Window->set_icon()?

- Syntax highlighting  (using Gtk2::SourceView ?) make it optional

- Bookmarks
- History of visited pages

- The scrolled windows should both be set to automatic on both directions; set a default size for the toplevel window to
  account for that; and use an HPaned instead of an HBox to contain the tree and text -- that gives the user more control
  over the size and position.

- setup vendor branch so I can easily track changes in the real versions
  of some of the examples as they appear in the GTK2 CVS.
- make examples pass use strict and use warnings;
- add more entries to the tutorial
- missing widgets:
  TreeSelection
- organize Examples and Cookbook

- Disable both execute button and save button for non-executable entries

- When saving a file with the name of an already existing file ask if user wants to rewrite ?

- Mark clearly on the item list which one is text and which one is code

- Have a list of all the signals and jump to files based on signal names ?

- Have an index of all the words in the comments and pod sections of the files ?
  Probably not needed now that we have full text search

- See also and somehow integrate with
  http://live.gnome.org/GTK2_2dPerl_2fRecipes

- The color snooper doesn't work --- it complains on the console that it needs an argument.
  change the script to have a default file or we will have to rework the whole examples invocation thing.


- It wasn't immediately obvious that i could edit the text to modify and run the samples.
  Some explanatory text and a "revert" button would be helpful.

- When moving form a buffer that was changed to show another file it silently discards all the
  changes made. It is not designated to be an editor or an IDE but still it might be annoying.

- Instead of the "List Widgets" button that turns into a "List Examples" button, you could place both trees into a
  notebook.

- Can we somehow include the Tutorial and maybe the full documentation?

DONE
=====================================

All the examples from the distrubtion are included

Multi level tree (so the various sections can be in expandable subtree)

Add execute button

Provide an index tables where we list all the Widgets we used in the examples
and where were they used. We might be able to list all the signal handlers
and where were they used.

Code for execution should be taken from the window and we should encourage people to
experiment with the various options.

Add save button to save the content of the code window (now that we do not have them in separate files)

- free text search in all the files

- cleanup README file
- Search should be invoked on ENTER when in search box
- Ctr-S should jump in the search text box
- Maybe search result window should be part of the main window and not a separate one.
- Search and highlight in the current window
- If you set the shadow type on the two scrolled windows to "in", the window will look a little better.
  Let's see this
- gtk-demo allows you to run scripts by activating their rows in the treeview (double-clicking or pressing enter).

- gtk-demo allows you to run more than one demo at a time.  Both of those features would be handy.
  (Since you can edit the script,
  it would be rather easy for a user to hose the demo.)
- We might want to run the external application on a fork so the user can run several
  versions at the same time and see the differences.
- Repeat search within the buffer pressing Ctr-N
- Mnemonics and stock icons would spruce up the main window a bit.
