# Drawing Area
#
# GtkDrawingArea is a blank area where you can draw custom displays
# of various kinds.
#
# This demo has two drawing areas. The checkerboard area shows
# how you can just draw something; all you have to do is write
# a signal handler for expose_event, as shown here.
#
# The "scribble" area is a bit more advanced, and shows how to handle
# events such as button presses and mouse motion. Click the mouse
# and drag in the scribble area to draw squiggles. Resize the window
# to clear the area.
